## Overview

A macOS app that takes a picture when the device awake from sleep.

This app is a menubar app and runs in the background.

Our face changes little by little day by day.

It is fun to watch your face change over the years.

## Background

I had been using a macOS app called [Snoop Catcher](https://macdaddy.io/snoop-catcher/) developed by MacDaddy for years.

This app had not been maintained for years and had stopped working properly since some recent versions of macOS.

This is why I decided to create this app.
