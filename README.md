A macOS app that takes a picture when the device awake from sleep

<br>

## Background

I had been used a macOS app called [Snoop Catcher](https://macdaddy.io/snoop-catcher/) developed by MacDaddy.

The app had no longer maintained for years and not working correctly since last several version of macOS.

This is the reason why I decided to make this app.

## Features

When your device awake from sleep, start built-in webcam and take a picture.

Your face is changing day by day.

It is just fun to show through your face changing for years.

### Change the folder to save

Change the folder from menubar icon.
